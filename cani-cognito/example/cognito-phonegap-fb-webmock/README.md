Cani-cognito phonegap-fb webmock
---

Here we're building a mobile application which uses cani-phonegap-fb

Buuut, we're REPLing with desktop chrome/firefox.

So, given there's no 'cordova' in window (aka we're running on the desktop)

we want to mock the phonegapFb plugin's login function to work with cani-fb
